description: 'AI models are crushing benchmarks. SWE-bench scores are climbing, and
  METR''s measured time horizons are rising rapidly. Yet when we deployed these same
  models in a field study with experienced developers, they didn''t speed up work.
  What''s going on? Are benchmarks misleading us about AI capabilities? Are we missing
  something about how AI performs in the real world? In this talk, we''ll reconcile
  lab and field evidence on AI capabilities. Drawing from METR''s time horizon measurements
  and developer productivity RCT, we''ll explore why impressive benchmark performance
  doesn''t always translate to real-world impact. We''ll examine potential explanations—from
  reliability requirements to task distribution to capability elicitation—and discuss
  what this means for automated AI R&D.
