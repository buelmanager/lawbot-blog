description: 'Too many MCP servers are simply glorified REST wrappers, regurgitating
  APIs that were designed for SDKs, not agents. This leads to confused LLMs, wasted
  tokens, and demonstrably poor performance. If you''ve ever pointed an MCP generator
  at an OpenAPI spec and called it a day, this talk is your intervention.


  Like any product, great MCP servers are the result of careful design. This talk
  shares the hard-won lessons from creating FastMCP, the most popular framework for
  building MCP servers (and yes, for generating them, too). The secret is to stop
  thinking about endpoints and start thinking about products. We will cover the three
  pillars of agent-native product design—Discovery, Iteration, and Context—providing
  an actionable framework for curating context into small, highly effective surface
  areas that lead to better AI outcomes.
