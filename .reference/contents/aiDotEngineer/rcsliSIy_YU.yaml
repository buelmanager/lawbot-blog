description: 'Today''s agents are best at small, atomic coding tasks. Much larger
  tasks--like major refactors and breaking dependency updates--are highly automatable
  but hard to one-shot.


  In this session, we''ll discuss patterns for orchestrating large-scale code changes
  with swarms of agents and a human in the loop.


  We''ll also work through a concrete example: migrating an entire codebase from one
  React state management library to another.
