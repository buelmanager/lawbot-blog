description: 'Everyone is building AI Agents, and everyone is looking for ways to
  build them more easily. Earlier this year, OpenAI released the OpenAI Agents SDK
  to bring the patterns they have found to work for building agents to the developer
  community. With the SDK you can define AI agents by supplying them instructions
  (prompts), specifying which model to use (OpenAI or not), listing tools it uses
  (including MCP), and much more. The OpenAI Agents SDK encourages a paradigm of orchestrated
  micro-agents, which themselves may have micro-orchestrations within them with the
  use of handoffs. It’s an elegant and powerful model.


  But a good AI Agents programming model is not enough. These agents are ultimately
  wildly distributed systems and are plagued with all of the problems such systems
  bring.


  - How can they persevere through flakey networks?

  - How can they function when LLMs are rate limited?

  - How can they run for long periods of time (hours, days, weeks, months) when infrastructure
  is rarely stable that long?


  In this workshop, we’ll show you how. Temporal is an open source (MIT license) durable
  execution framework that brings resilience to AI agents, and in this workshop we’ll
  show you how it’s done with the OpenAI Agents SDK. Spoiler: OpenAI and Temporal
  have done all of the heaving lifting for you with an integration announced earlier
  this year.


  Oh, and OpenAI themselves use Temporal to help make several of their products production
  ready (image gen and Codex, for example).


  Not using the OpenAI Agents SDK? Do come anyway; the foundational concepts carry
  over to different agent frameworks (and more integrations are coming all the time).
